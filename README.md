# Php Authentication

I have built a basic `php` authentication system with `mysql` database where a user can't access to a route without login credentials. It was built during my learning process.

PS: This System is vulnerable to `SQL Injection`. Be Cautious if you use.

## Deployment

To deploy this project run

```bash
  git clone https://github.com/james-bhattarai/php-authentication.git
```
If you are on Windows then Install `XAMPP` and copy the file to `C:\xampp\htdocs`
